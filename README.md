# TinyBoard

TinyBoard is TensorBoard for PyTorch and other popular deep learning frameworks.

## Installation

If you are a [TinyMind](https://www.tinymind.ai) user, the right version of TinyBoard is automatically installed for you and you don't need to do anything extra.

To use TinyBoard outside of TinyMind, install it via `pip`:

```sh
pip install tinyboard
```

This installs the barebone TinyBoard for you. To use framework-specific functionalities, install their corresponding extensions, such as:

```sh
pip install tinyboard[pytorch]
```
